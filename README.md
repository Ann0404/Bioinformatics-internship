# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite truly *intimidating* but my love for bioinformatics surpases this fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time: 
First milestone
Second milestone
### First milestone  
* Understand the workings of github  
* Create a roadmap  
### Second milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios  
### Third milestone  
* Learn Python (super excited for that!!)  
### Fourth milestone  
* Learn R  
*
