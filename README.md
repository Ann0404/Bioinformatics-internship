# Bioinformatics-internship
**Diary of an intern**  
This is the description of my journey at ICIPE  
## **Vision**  
* To be a whole rounded bioinformatician.  
## **Mission**  
* To wholly embrace my training at ICIPE.  
* To participate in every aspect of my training.  
* To identify mentors to guide me in this genomic journey.  
# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite intimidating but my love for bioinformatics surpases the fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:  
### First milestone  
* Understand the workings of github  
* Create a roadmap  
### Second milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios
