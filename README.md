# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite truly *intimidating* but my love for bioinformatics surpases this fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:    

### First milestone  
* Understand the workings of github  
* Create a roadmap
  
### Second milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios
  
### Third milestone  
* Learn Python (super excited for that!!) 
 
### Fourth milestone  
* Learn R ( super nervous :) )  
* Understand and farmiliarise myself with netflow    
* Learn and understand data science and its comparison with bioinformatics
    
### Fifth milestone  
* Learn how to carry out the different downstream processes post sequencing on a terminal
 especially trimming, contig assembly, multiple sequence alignments and phylogeny.
 
 ### Sixth milestone  
 I hope to apply everything I have learnt to a project.  
 
 By the end of this internship i hope to be able to manipulate and analyse any genomic data especially metagenomic data.
 
 And in all have fun
