# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite truly *intimidating* but my love for bioinformatics surpases this fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:    

### Milestone  
* Define my vission and mission
* Create a roadmap
  
### Milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios
* Understand the workings of github

### Milestone ( programming languages) 
* Bash
* R 
* Python
 
### Milestone  
* Understand and farmiliarise myself with netflow    
* Learn and understand data science and its comparison with bioinformatics
    
### Milestone  
* Learn how to carry out the different downstream processes post sequencing on a terminal
 especially trimming, contig assembly, multiple sequence alignments and phylogeny as well as create better workflows.
 
 ### Milestone  
 I hope to apply everything I have learnt to a project. 
 
 ### Milestone (soft skills)  
 * Presentation  
 * Scientific writing
 * Power point preparation  
 
 By the end of this internship i hope to be able to manipulate and analyse any genomic data especially metagenomic data.
 
 And in all have fun
