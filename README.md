# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite truly *intimidating* but my love for bioinformatics surpases this fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:    

### Milestone  
* [ ] Define my vision and mission
* [ ] Create a roadmap
  
### Milestone  
* [ ] Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* [ ] Apply these said commands in different scenarios
* [ ] Understand the workings of github

### Milestone ( programming languages) 
* [ ] Bash
* [ ] R 
* [ ] Python
 
### Milestone  
* [ ] Understand and farmiliarise myself with netflow    
* [ ] Learn and understand data science and its comparison with bioinformatics
    
### Milestone  
* [ ] Learn how to carry out the different downstream processes post sequencing on a terminal
 especially trimming, contig assembly, multiple sequence alignments and phylogeny as well as create better workflows.
 
 ### Milestone  
 * [ ] Reproducing a paper  
 * [ ] Mini-project
 
 ### Milestone (soft skills)  
 * [ ] Presentation  
 * [ ] Scientific writing
* [ ] Power point preparation
By the end of this internship i hope to be able to manipulate and analyse any genomic data especially metagenomic data.
 
 And in all have fun
