ROADMAP

# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite truly *intimidating* but my love for bioinformatics surpases this fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:    

### Milestone  
* Define my vission and mission
* Create a roadmap
  
### Milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios
* Understand the workings of github

### Milestone ( programming languages) 
* Bash
* R 
* Python
 
### Milestone  
* Understand and farmiliarise myself with netflow    
* Learn and understand data science and its comparison with bioinformatics
    
### Milestone  
* Learn how to carry out the different downstream processes post sequencing on a terminal
 especially trimming, contig assembly, multiple sequence alignments and phylogeny as well as create better workflows.
 
 ### Milestone  
 I hope to apply everything I have learnt to a project. 
 
 ### Milestone (soft skills)  
 * Presentation  
 * Scientific writing
 * Power point preparation  
 
 By the end of this internship i hope to be able to manipulate and analyse any genomic data especially metagenomic data.
 
 And in all have fun

# Bioinformatics-internship  
Ann here! I have started this ***great*** internship at ICIPE and I am going to try and note down the different things I will learn from my time here.:) This internship will provide me with the skills I require to navigate the field of AMR genes and manipulate any data to fit a specific goal. Let's get started!!  

## **Welcome to the diary of an intern**  
This is the description of my four month journey at ICIPE  
## **Vision**  
* To understand and apply the aspects of computational biology including Python and R to the research on AMR genes using metagenomic data, as an initial step in drug discovery by establishing new drug targets.
## **Mission**  
My mission is to understand and apply the knowledge gained from this internship to navigate the different bioinformatic tools available for analysis of AMR genes for the purpose of identifying new drug targets as well as for evolutionary studies. In addition to that I also hope:
* To wholly embrace my training at ICIPE.  
* To understand and apply python and R in creating better workflows.  
* To carry out the different genomic analysis processes comfortably on a terminal.  
* To design algorithms that will enable efficient analyisis of data.
* To identify and approach mentors.
