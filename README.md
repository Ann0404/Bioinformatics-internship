# Bioinformatics-internship  
Ann here! I have started this ***great*** internship at ICIPE and I am going to try and note down the different things I will learn from my time here.:) This internship will provide me with the skills I require to navigate the field of AMR genes and manipulate any data to fit a specific goal. Let's get started!!
