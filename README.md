# ROADMAP  
Learning programming is quite intimidating but my love for bioinformatics surpases the fear.  
To tone down the nerves. I have established these milestones to help achieve one goal at a time:  
### First milestone  
* Understand the workings of github  
* Create a roadmap  
### Second milestone  
* Understand the basic commands of linux.  
* Apply these said commands in different scenarios
