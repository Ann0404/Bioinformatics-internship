# Bioinformatics-internship  
Ann here! I have started this ***great*** internship at ICIPE and I am going to try and note down the different things I will learn from my time here.:) This internship will provide me with the skills I require to navigate the field of AMR genes and manipulate any data to fit a specific goal. Let's get started!!  

## **Welcome to the diary of an intern**  
This is the description of my four month journey at ICIPE  
## **Vision**  
* To understand and apply the aspects of computational biology including Python and R to the research on AMR genes using metagenomic data as an initial step in drug discovery by identifying new drug targets.
## **Mission**  
* To wholly embrace my training at ICIPE.  
* To understand and apply python and R in creating better workflows.  
*  
* To identify mentors to guide me in this genomic journey.
